# Kaggle: must-do list

## Data Preprocessing

- accelerate file IO: convert csv data to hdf5 or binary formatted file.  
- impute missing data
- reduce duplicates
- remove non-representative samples (subsets that are not helpful in building models that generalize in the test data). 

## Data Explorative Analysis

- categorical features: calculate mutual information with labels
- numeric features:
- date features:

## Model Setup

- examinng train/test split, and create local validation w.r.t. that. 
- choose the proper model to start with: XGB or RandomForest
